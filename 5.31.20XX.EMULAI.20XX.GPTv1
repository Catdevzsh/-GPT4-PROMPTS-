The implications of this README is unclear, though it appears to be very secretive. It is also believed the "leading competitor" that is referenced is Project64, which has built-in cheats for some ROMs. Notably, EmulAI in Italian can mean rival, which implies a rivalry between Project64 and EmulAI.
