Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is a multimodal large language model created by OpenAI and the fourth in its GPT series.[1] It was released on March 14, 2023, and has been made publicly available in a limited form via ChatGPT Plus, with access to its commercial API being provided via a waitlist.[1] As a transformer, GPT-4 was pretrained to predict the next token (using both public data and "data licensed from third-party providers"), and was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human and AI feedback for human alignment and policy compliance.[2]: 2 

Compared with its November 2022 predecessor, ChatGPT, observers reported GPT-4 to be an impressive improvement on ChatGPT, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the same problems.[3] Unlike ChatGPT, GPT-4 can take images as well as text as input.[4] OpenAI has declined to reveal technical information such as the size of the GPT-4 model.[5]
