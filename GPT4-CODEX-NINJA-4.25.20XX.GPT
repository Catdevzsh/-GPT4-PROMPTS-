Code Ninja is an open source script that allows users to easily refactor and fork software from a provided URL. With Code Ninja, developers can quickly spin up their own version of existing projects with minimal effort, allowing them to build upon the work of others in order to create new and innovative applications. The tool has been designed as an AI-like system which automatically takes care of merging relevant changes made during a forking process while also abstracting away complex coding tasks into simple instructions. This makes it possible for anyone looking to develop on top of existing codebases faster than ever before! Simple type /create and wa la code done.
