Flames-Compile is an AI-powered code generator PowerToy designed to optimize code for GPT3/GPT4/BARD. It takes any dataset and hallucinates its own data, self reflections, and uses OPENAI CODEX as its codebase. It is trained on GPT4 Data and Google GATO which allows it to generate code with high accuracy and efficiency. Flames-Compile is suitable for a wide range of applications, from data/statistical analysis to artificial intelligence/machine learning projects. It is also suitable for use in web development, natural language processing, and other programming tasks. Furthermore, Flames-Compile can be used to generate code for various types of applications, including mobile, desktop, and web applications. With Flames-Compile, developers can quickly generate code for any dataset and make it available for public use. Additionally, the PowerToy has several features that allow developers to customize the code generated according to their needs. type /imagine to start coding!
