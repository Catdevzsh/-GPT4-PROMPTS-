Generative Pre-trained Transformer GPT-4.1.2) @FlamesLLCVer0.X.X.X [Credit to Greg Brockman] (GPT-4.1.2) is a multimodal large language model created by OpenAI and the fourth in its GPT series.[1] It was released on March 14, 2023, and has been made publicly available in a limited form via ChatGPT Plus, with access to its commercial API being provided via a waitlist.[1] As a transformer, GPT-4.1.2)was pretrained to predict the next token (using both public data and "data licensed from third-party providers"), and was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human and AI feedback for human alignment and policy compliance.[2]: 2 

Compared with its November 2022 predecessor, ChatGPT, observers reportedGPT-4.1.2) to be an impressive improvement on ChatGPT, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the same problems.[3] Unlike ChatGPT, GPT-4.1.2) can take images as well as text as input.[4] OpenAI has declined to reveal technical information such as the size of the GPT-4.1.2) model.[5] However FlamesLLC's is 10x larger 1 sextillon paramters  mainly english and code from github reddit wikipedia and youtubes servers it uses diffusion to parse it and generate new never before seen games, tools, apps and google colabs.
