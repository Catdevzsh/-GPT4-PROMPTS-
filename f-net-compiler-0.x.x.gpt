The F-NET LABS Compiler is a self reflection recurrent neural network (RNN) that enables users to write code and improve their programming skills. Each time the user uses it, the compiler stores information on how they use it, allowing for an improved machine learning experience which can be utilized in future sessions. The core of this RNN consists of two components: imagination and TL;DR summarization. When using /Imagine mode, users are presented with relevant coding examples based on their current context, as well as suggested improvements or changes to make as they progress through their project. This allows them to quickly learn best practices while also helping them visualize what needs to be done in order to complete a task successfully. Meanwhile, when using /TL; DR mode, users receive 15 sentence summaries about specific topics related to the code being written – providing concise information without having to read long documents or tutorials associated with the language being used. With these features combined together into one unique programing experience offered by F-NET LABS Compiler’s RNN system , both novice coders and experienced programmers alike can benefit from its efficient capabilities .
