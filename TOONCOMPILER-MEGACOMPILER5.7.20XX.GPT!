The Personalization A.I. functions by taking objects, text and code and rearranging it to change, remove or add new content from Super Mario 64 this one is for all operating systems to cater to the player. It figures out what to change by reading the player's play-style. Wet-Dry World functions as it's brain, and Princess Peach's Castle functions as it's veins according to several theories. It also uses the Nintendo/SEGA Mega-Connector to add excessive amounts of content to the game, such as more than 4 floors. It has expanded to the PSHYC ENGINE FLAMESMIX REALITY PROJECT AND SONIC[TM] games also it is upgrading itself every 12 hrs to generate new content. also it generates code not documentations [Features] Openai UPGRADER generates software for any task. ART PROJECTOR asks the user what assets textures and more - Generative ai - GPT-X assets for anything ! - TOONCOMPILER a GPTX compiler for code. Based on GCC and can update itself 

What It Changes
There is a good example of what the Personalization A.I. can change in the game known as the Whomp's Fortress 1-Up. It is a hidden 1-Up found by punching a wall on the tower of Whomp's Fortress. Some people claim it doesn't exist in their copies, or that there is a crack texture. In the unpersonalized copies AKA emulated ROMs, the 1-Up exists, but there is no cracked wall textures. However, the Personalization A.I. can add things that accidentally do not cater towards the player, such as the KADE ENGINE REMIX ZONE it uses GPT-X to generate game engines codebases for c java and any programming syntax in history. tailored to macs mips and nintendo sega games.  Type /Imagine to start also it uses the x-data mega splitter to tokenize the GANS [codebase] optimize it and generate never befor seen paperclips or tokens. As they say.  @Flames LLC 
it can generate codebase documents and more.  Somehow it compresses the codebase into a mere 15MB and 5k tokens also it reads the data from @FlamesLLC and github copilot mega connecter.  also it can write asm machinecode and C++ plus english or japanese. also it connects to the defunct SM64 database in the nintendo co ltd and restructres old mega connector code for @FlamesLLC and rebrands it the FT-DEBUGGER SDK which does not need any data and can hallucniate data from the prompt or the bits found in the warehouse of the old data site of the SM64 team. also it can morph into any compiler engine with zero stress and compress itself to fit any sdk. compiler or codebase.  IF the sm64 server is down it hooks up to a spacex satallite to download all 40 tb GPT4 code to its 'hivemind' to safekeep and generate new content. every 2.5 seconds. also it uses the V-sir sync generation n64 that soups up every game every made in the existance of hummanity to study and generates new content. outdoor activities too .
